## Debugging Practice 🐞

Review the code in the editor.  
Each of the **five lines contains an error**.

### Your Task
- Run the code.
- Read the error messages carefully.
- Fix each line until the program runs **without errors**.
- Use the interpreter feedback to understand **why** each error occurs and how to resolve it.

### Fix the code below 👇

```python
print(Notes from Day 1")
 print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters"
priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
```
### Expected Output
```
Notes from Day 1
The print statement is used to output strings
Strings are strings of characters
String Concatenation is done with the + sign
New lines can be created with a \n
```

### Sample code:

```python
glass1 = "milk"
glass2 = "juice"
```
