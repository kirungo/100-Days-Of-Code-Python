## Randomisation and Python Lists
<em> Notes: </em>
Using the random module to be able to build programs that spit out a different random output anytime we learn them
Computers are deterministc they will perform repeated actions in a fully predictable way.

```python

import random # how to import the random module
rand_num = random.randint(1, 10) # in the random module we want to use intergers hence the function we will call is the .randint, 1 to 10 represent the range we want to work with
print(rand_num) #This will produce a random whole number between 1 and 10 (inclusive)


```
