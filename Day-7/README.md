# Day 7: Hangman Project

*Notes:* </br>
You'll be using everytjing you know and have learnt to build the code equivalent of the hangman project.

Rules:

1. The computer generates for you a random word,
2. You have to guess which letter are in that word.
3. For every wrong letter you submit, a life is reduced from the little man.
4. If you get a letter right the game pauses and the letter is added as part of the word n the position it was uspposed to be in.
5. At all times you'll be told the number of lives you have remaining.
