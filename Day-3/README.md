## Day 3 • Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks & Scope


### Notes: 

Condition Checks in Python </em>

We use conditionals in Python to check a condition and tell the computer what to do in each situation. For example:


```python
if <condition is TRUE>:
    <execute this line>
else:
    print("Execute this block if the condition is false")
```

If the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to `False`, the code inside the `else` block runs instead.

<em> Comparator Operators </em>

```python
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
== Equal to
!= Not equal t
```
