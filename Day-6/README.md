# Day 6: Functions, Code Blocks and While Loops

*Notes:*  </br>
Functions: We have already used some functions for example the print(), len()

Python uses a 4 spaces indentation, Spaces are the preffered indentation method.

Python style guide can be found [Python Documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

```python
# Defining a function
def my_function():
    # What we want the function to do
    print("Hello World")
    print("Bye")

# Calling the function
my_function()
```

*While Loop* </br>
While loop only stops when the statement being checked becomes false.
When not sure while the while loop is infinite print out the condition attached to the while loop.

```python
while something_is true:
    # Do this
    # While loop executes as long as the condition is true
```
