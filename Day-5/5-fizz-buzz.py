""" FizzBuzz Game
Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. 
These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
1. Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
2. But when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
3. When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
4. And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
5. e.g. it might start off like this:
   1
   2
   Fizz
   4
   Buzz

# Create a loop with For and Range to go from 1 to 100.

    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:

    # Then check if the number is only divisible by 3
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    
    # Finally check if the number is only divisible by 5
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    
    # If it's not divisible by either of those numbers, just print the number
