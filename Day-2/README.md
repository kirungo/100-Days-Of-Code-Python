## BMI Calculator

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure used in medicine to see if someone is underweight or overweight. 
This is the formula used to calculate it:
- bmi is equal to the person's weight divided by the person's height squared.


### Sample Code
```python
height = 1.65 
weight = 84

# Write your code here.
# Calculate the bmi using weight and height.
bmi =

print(bmi)

```
- Run the code.
- Read the error messages carefully.
- Fix each line until the program runs **without errors**.
- Use the interpreter feedback to understand **why** each error occurs and how to resolve it.
